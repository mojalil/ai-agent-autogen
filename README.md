The **AI Research Agents** project leverages the Autogen framework to develop and deploy autonomous agents for conducting cutting-edge AI research. The project is built using Python and is designed to provide a robust infrastructure for exploring, developing, and testing AI algorithms.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Agents**: Design and implementation of autonomous agents capable of conducting research autonomously.
- **Flexible Framework**: Utilizes the Autogen framework to provide a modular and scalable infrastructure.
- **AI Algorithm Testing**: Enables rigorous testing and evaluation of AI algorithms.
- **Collaborative Research**: Supports collaborative research initiatives with easy integration and data sharing.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- The `agents/` directory contains the implementation of various research agents.
- The `framework/` directory houses the Autogen framework integration.
- The `tests/` directory includes all the test scripts to ensure the system's robustness and correctness.

## Functions
1. `create_agent()`: Creates a new research agent.
2. `run_experiment()`: Executes an experiment using the specified agent and parameters.
3. `evaluate_agent()`: Evaluates the performance of an agent.
4. `share_results()`: Shares the results of experiments with the community.
5. `load_dataset()`: Loads a dataset for use in experiments.
6. `train_model()`: Trains a machine learning model using the provided dataset and parameters.

## Usage
To get started with the AI Research Agents project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `conda install --file requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main script to initiate the research agents: `python main.py`.

## Running Tests
To run individual tests, use the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests -p '*_test.py'
```
Or, for more verbose output:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests -p '*_test.py' -v
```
